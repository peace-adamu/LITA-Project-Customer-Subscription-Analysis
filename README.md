### Discussion of SQL Query: Total Number of Customers from Each Region
Query:
sql code
```
SELECT 
    Region,
    COUNT(CustomerID) AS total_customers
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
GROUP BY 
    Region
ORDER BY 
    TotalCustomers DESC;
```
#### Result:![sql1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ac37d5-e9cf-43a5-a859-15f81451b52e)

- North: 18,750

### Discussion of SQL Query: Most Popular Subscription Type by Number of Customers
#### Query:
sql code
```
SELECT 
    SubscriptionType,
    COUNT(CustomerID) AS number_of_customers
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
GROUP BY 
    SubscriptionType
ORDER BY 
    number_of_customers DESC;
```
#### Result:![sql2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc45da7-c15c-4a72-a215-9243782d2a34)

- Basic: 37,500 customers
- Premium: 18,750 customers
- Standard: 18,750 customers
#### Key Insight:
Popularity: The Basic subscription type is the most popular, with double the number of customers compared to Premium and Standard. This suggests that customers prefer the Basic subscription, potentially due to its pricing or features.

### Discussion of SQL Query: Customers Who Canceled Their Subscription Within 6 Months
#### Query:
sql code
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    CustomerName,
    SubscriptionType,
    SubscriptionStart,
    SubscriptionEnd,
    DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) AS subscription_duration_months
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
WHERE 
    Canceled = 'TRUE'
    AND DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) <= 6;
```
#### Result:![sql3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0955502-d666-471d-90e8-622bfa368f8e)

No results found.
#### Key Insight:
Customer Retention: There were no customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months. This indicates strong customer retention during the early months of subscription, suggesting satisfaction with the service or effective onboarding and engagement strategies.

### Discussion of SQL Query: Calculate the Average Subscription Duration for All Customers
#### Query:
sql code
```
SELECT 
    AVG(DATEDIFF(day, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd)) AS average_subscription_duration_days,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd)) AS average_subscription_duration_months
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2];
```
#### Result:![sql4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6381be-b751-4181-bf73-518700d1bfb6)

- Average Subscription Duration (Days): 365 days
- Average Subscription Duration (Months): 12 months
#### Key Insight:
Consistency in Subscription Length: The average subscription duration is exactly 12 months, indicating that most customers maintain their subscriptions for a full year. This uniformity suggests that the subscription plans are likely annual, and customers are not canceling or renewing midway through the year. This consistency can be a positive indicator of customer satisfaction and the effectiveness of annual subscription models.

### SQL Query Discussion: Customers with Subscriptions Longer Than 12 Months
#### Query: 
sql code
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    CustomerName,
    SubscriptionType,
    SubscriptionStart,
    SubscriptionEnd,
    DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) AS subscription_duration_months
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
WHERE 
    DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) > 12;
```
#### Results:![sql5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac41922-6664-4acd-898c-0e41ee5df634)

No Results: The query returned no customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
#### Key Points:
- Subscription Duration: All subscriptions in the dataset are 12 months or less.
- Consistency: Aligns with the previous analysis showing an average subscription duration of 12 months.
This query confirms that no customer has a subscription duration exceeding 12 months, suggesting a standard annual subscription model.

### SQL Query Discussion: Calculate Total Revenue by Subscription Type
#### Query: 
sql code
```
SELECT 
    SubscriptionType,
    SUM(Revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
GROUP BY 
    SubscriptionType;
```
#### Results:![sql6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7572d998-f0e5-4b61-be7e-62885b0929eb)

- Basic: $74,756,784
- Premium: $37,580,782
- Standard: $37,482,120
#### Key Points:
- Total Revenue: The total revenue generated by each subscription type.
- Highest Revenue: The Basic subscription generates the highest revenue, followed by Premium and Standard.
This query provides a clear view of the revenue distribution across different subscription types, highlighting the financial performance and popularity of each subscription tier.

### SQL Query Discussion: Find the Top 3 Regions by Subscription Cancellations
#### Query:
sql code
```
SELECT TOP 3 
    Region, 
    COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCancellations
FROM 
   [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
WHERE 
    Canceled = 1
GROUP BY 
    Region
ORDER BY 
    TotalCancellations DESC;
```
#### Results:![sql7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c97ad54-0ac6-44b7-ae2c-48fff357cee9)

- West: 11,250 cancellations
- South: 11,250 cancellations
- North: 11,250 cancellations
#### Key Points:
- Equal Cancellations: The top three regions (West, South, and North) all have the same number of cancellations.
- Top 3 Regions: These regions are identified as having the highest number of cancellations.
This query helps in identifying the regions with the highest subscription cancellations, which is crucial for understanding customer retention issues in different geographic areas.

### SQL Query Discussion: Subscription Status Summary
#### Query 1: Group By Canceled Status
sql code
```
SELECT 
    Canceled,
    COUNT(CustomerID) AS total_subscriptions
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2]
GROUP BY 
    Canceled;
```
#### Query 2: Summarize Active and Canceled Subscriptions
sql code
```
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'FALSE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveSubscriptions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS CanceledSubscriptions
FROM 
    [dbo].[capstone-sql2];

```
#### Results:![sql8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346c2b46-2d03-4664-8cdf-ea243c5e9221)

- Active Subscriptions: 41,250
- Canceled Subscriptions: 33,750
#### Key Points:
- Active Subscriptions: There are 41,250 active subscriptions.
- Canceled Subscriptions: There are 33,750 canceled subscriptions.
These queries provide an overview of the total number of active and canceled subscriptions, helping to understand the overall subscription status of the customer base.

## Conclusion
The Customer Subscription Analysis project, encompassing Excel, SQL, and Power BI, has provided a comprehensive view of subscription performance.

In the Excel phase, pivot tables revealed key insights into revenue distribution, top-performing stores, and line of business metrics. These foundational insights facilitated a deeper understanding of sales dynamics across different dimensions.

Using SQL, detailed data extraction and transformation were achieved. SQL queries calculated active and cancelled subscriptions, aggregated revenue by subscription type and region, and performed cohort analysis to track customer behavior over time.

Power BI brought the data to life through interactive dashboards, visualizing metrics such as active subscriptions, total subscriptions, cohort months, and cancelled subscriptions. Key findings included:

Basic subscriptions generated the highest revenue.
The East region had the highest active subscriptions with no cancellations.
North, South, and West regions had similar active subscriptions but high cancellations.
Identified peak churn months varied by region.
The project revealed that the East region's practices could be a model for success in other regions. There is a need to develop targeted retention strategies for regions with high cancellations. Promoting Basic subscriptions while enhancing Premium and Standard offerings can balance revenue streams. Leveraging cohort analysis will help anticipate and mitigate churn, ensuring proactive customer retention.

Overall, the integrated approach has provided actionable intelligence for optimizing subscription performance, enhancing customer retention, and maximizing revenue across all regions and subscription types.
